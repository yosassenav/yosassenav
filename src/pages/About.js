     I was born and raised in Mexico. I started this journey back in
          2016 when I was a student, right now I am currently working
          in the hospitality industry as an Identity and access
          management analyst. <br/><br/> I'd love to expand my knowledge in the IT
          industry by assuming roles that allow me to challenge myself
          and learn new things!
